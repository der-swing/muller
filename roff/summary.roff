The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in
sweeping and systematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations
began to surface in mid-2016. In June, the Democratic National Committee
and its cyber response team publicly announced that Russian hackers had
compromised its computer network. Releases of hacked materials-hacks that
public reporting soon attributed to the Russian government-began that
same month.  Additional releases followed in July through the organization
WikiLeaks, with further releases in October and November.
.PP
In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks's first release of stolen documents,
a foreign government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with
Trump Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos
had suggested to a representative of that foreign government that the Trump
Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could
assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging
to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information
prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether
individuals associated with the Trump Campaign were coordinating with the
Russian government in its interference activities.  That fall, two federal
agencies jointly announced that the Russian government "directed recent
compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political
organizations," and, "[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere
with the US election process." After the election, in late December 2016,
the United States imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the
election. By early 2017, several congressional committees were examining
Russia's interference in the election.  Within the Executive Branch, these
investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017 appointment of Special
Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the Special Counsel
authorized him to investigate "the Russian government's efforts to interfere
in the 2016 presidential election," including any links or coordination
between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump
Campaign.  As set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel's
investigation established that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential
election principally through two operations. First, a Russian entity carried
out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J.
Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian
intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities,
employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released
stolen documents. The investigation also identified numerous links between
the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although the investigation
established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a
Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign
expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released
through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members
of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government
in its election interference activities.

Below we describe the evidentiary considerations underpinning statements
about the results of our investigation and the Special Counsel's charging
decisions, and we then provide an overview of the two volumes of our report.
The report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel's Office
found to be supported by the evidence collected in our investigation. In
some instances, the report points out the absence of evidence or conflicts
in the evidence about a particular fact or event. In other instances, when
substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion
with confidence, the report states that the investigation established that
certain actions or events occurred. A statement that the investigation did not
establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts.
In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals
constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the
concept of "collusion." In so doing, the Office recognized that the word
"collud[e]" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General
confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term
has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But
collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the
United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For
those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal
liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with
that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump
Campaign "coordinat[ed]" - a term that appears in the appointment order - with
Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, "coordination"
does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood
coordination to require an agreement - tacit or express - between the Trump
Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires
more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive
to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that
sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish
that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its
election interference activities.

The report on our investigation consists of two volumes: Volume I describes the
factual results of the Special Counsel's investigation of Russia's interference
in the 2016 presidential election and its interactions with the Trump Campaign.
Section I describes the scope of the investigation. Sections II and III
describe the principal ways Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential
election. Section IV describes links between the Russian government and
individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Section V sets forth the
Special Counsel's charging decisions.  Volume II addresses the President's
actions towards the FBI's investigation into Russia's interference in the
2016 presidential election and related matters, and his actions towards the
Special Counsel's investigation. Volume II separately states its framework
and the considerations that guided that investigation
.SH 1
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME I
.SH 2
RUSSIAN SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN
.LP
The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian
interference operations identified by the investigation- a social media
campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord
in the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and
received funding from Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he
controlled. Prigozhin is widely reported to have ties to Russian President
Vladimir Putin, [...]  In mid-2014, the IRA sent employees to the United
States on an intelligence-gathering mission with instructions [...]
.PP
The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in
the U.S.  political system through what it termed "information warfare." The
campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to
undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early
2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton.  The IRA' s
operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social
media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging
of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies,
IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact
with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The
investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or
coordinated with the IRA. Section II of this report details the Office's
investigation of the Russian social media campaign.
.SH 2
RUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS
.LP
At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus ·on supporting
candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form
of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials
damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as
the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army
(GRU) carried out these operations.
.PP
In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign
volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In
April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee
(DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised
email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in
mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU
began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas
"DCLeaks" and "Guccifer 2.0." The GRU later released additional materials
through the organization WikiLeaks.
.PP
The presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump ("Trump Campaign" or "Campaign")
showed interest in WikiLeaks's releases of documents and welcomed their
potential to damage candidate Clinton. Beginning in June 2016, [...] forecast
to senior Campaign officials that WikiLeaks would release information damaging
to candidate Clinton. WikiLeaks's first release came in July 2016. Around
the same time, candidate Trump announced that he hoped Russia would recover
emails described as missing from a private server used b Clinton when she
was Secretary of State (he later said that he was speaking sarcastically).
.PP
WikiLeaks began releasing Podesta's stolen emails on October 7, 2016,
less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released video considered
damaging to candidate Trump. Section lII of this Report details the Office's
investigation into the Russian hacking operations, as well as other efforts
by Trump Campaign supporters to obtain Clinton-related emails.
.SH 2
RUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN
.LP
The social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a
series of contacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties
to the Russian government.  The Office investigated whether those contacts
reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring or coordinating with
Russia in its election-interference activities. Although the investigation
established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a
Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign
expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released
through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members
of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government
in its election interference activities.

The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance
to the Campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person,
invitations for Campaign officials and representatives of the Russian
government to meet, and policy positions seeking improved U.S.-Russian
relations. Section IV of this Report details the contacts between Russia
and the Trump Campaign during the campaign and transition periods, the most
salient of which are summarized below in chronological order.

2015. Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a
Trump Organization real-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower
Moscow. Candidate Trump signed a Letter of intent for Trump Tower Moscow by
November 2015, and in January 2016 Trump Organization executive Michael Cohen
emailed and spoke about the project with the office of Russian government
press secretary Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project
through at least June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen
and candidate Trump.  Spring 2016. Campaign foreign policy advisor George
Papadopoulos made early contact with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor
who had connections to Russia and traveled to Moscow in April 2016. Immediately
upon his return to London from that trip, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the
Russian government had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of
emails. One week later, in the first week of May 2016, Papadopoulos suggested
to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had
received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the
Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to candidate
Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for several months thereafter,
Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a
meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting took place.

Summer 2016. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer
of 2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee
for President. On June 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior
Trump Campaign officials Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman
Paul Manafort to deliver what the email proposing the meeting had described
as "official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary." The
materials were offered to Trump Jr. as "part of Russia and its government's
support for Mr. Trump." The written communications setting up the meeting
showed that the Campaign anticipated receiving information from Russia that
could assist candidate Trump's electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer's
presentation did not provide such information.

Days after the June 9 meeting, on June 14 , 2016, a cybersecurity firm
and the DNC announced that Russian government hackers had infiltrated the
DNC and obtained access to opposition research on candidate Trump, among
other documents.  In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page
traveled in his personal capacity to Moscow and gave the keynote address at
the New Economic School. Page had lived and worked in Russia between 2003
and 2007. After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted with
at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was later charged
in 2015 with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia. Page's
July 2016 trip to Moscow and his advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy
drew media attention. The Campaign then distanced itself from Page and,
by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign.

July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the
GRU from the DNC. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC
documents revealing information about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there
was public reporting that U.S.  intelligence agencies had "high confidence"
that the Russian government was.behind the theft of emails and documents from
the DNC. And within a week of the release, a foreign government informed the
FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that
the Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016,
based on the foreign government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation
into potential coordination between the Russian government and individuals
associated with the Trump Campaign.

Separately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in
New York City with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who
the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik requested
the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort
acknowledged to the Special Counsel's Office was a "backdoor" way for Russia
to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require
candidate Trump 's assent to succeed (were he to be elected President). They
also discussed the status of the Trump Campaign and Manafort's strategy for
winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states.  Months before that meeting,
Manafort had caused internal polling data to be shared with Kilimnik, and
the sharing continued for some period of time after their August meeting.

Fall 2016. On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump
speaking in graphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered
damaging to his candidacy. Less than an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second
release: thousands of John Podesta's emails that had been stolen by the
GRU in late March 2016. The FBI and other U.S. government institutions were
at the time continuing their investigation of suspected Russian government
efforts to interfere in the presidential election. That same day, October
7, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence issued a joint public statement "that the Russian
Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and
institutions, including from US political organizations." Those "thefts"
and the "disclosures" of the hacked materials through online platforms such
as WikiLeaks, the statement continued, "are intended to interfere with the
US election process."

Post-2016 Election. Immediately after the November 8 election, Russian
government officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make
inroads into the new administration. The most senior levels of the Russian
government encouraged these efforts. The Russian Embassy made contact hours
after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to arrange a call
with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen picked up the effort from
there.  

Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia's sovereign
wealth fund, was among the Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming
administration. In early December, a business associate steered Dmitriev to
Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump Campaign and an associate of senior
Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince later met face-to-face in

January 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.-Russia relations. During
the same period, another business associate introduced Dmitriev to a friend
of Jared Kushner who had not served on the Campaign or the Transition
Team. Dmitriev and Kushner's friend collaborated on a short written
reconciliation plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev
implied had been cleared through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to
Kushner before the inauguration, and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon
and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

On December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia
for having interfered in the election. Incoming National Security Advisor
Michael Flynn called Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not
to escalate the situation in response to the sanctions. The following day,
Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in response
to the sanctions at that time. Hours later, President-Elect Trump tweeted,
"Great move on delay (by V. Putin)." The next day, on December 31 , 2016,
Kislyak called Flynn and told him the request had been received at the highest
levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result of Flynn's request.

.PP
On January 6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed
President-Elect Trump on a joint assessment - drafted and coordinated among
the Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, and National Security Agency - that
concluded with high confidence that Russia had intervened in the election
through a variety of means to assist Trump's candidacy and harm Clinton's. A
declassified version of the assessment was publicly released that same day.
.PP
Between mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional
committees -the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI),
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary
Committee (SJC) - announced that they would conduct inquiries, or had already
been conducting inquiries, into Russian interference in the election. Then-FBI
Director James Comey later confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI's
investigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election. On
March 20, 2017, in open-session testimony before HPSCI, Comey stated:
.QP
I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI,
as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian
government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that
includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated
with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was
any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts .... As with any
counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of
whether any crimes were committed.
.LP
The investigation continued under then-Director Comey for the next seven weeks
until May 9, 2017, when President Trump fired Comey as FBI Director - an action
which is analyzed in Volume II of the report.  
.PP
On May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel and authorized him to
conduct the investigation that Comey had confirmed in his congressional
testimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation,
and any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F .R . § 600.4(a), which
generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the investigation.
.PP
President Trump reacted negatively to the Special Counsel's appointment. He
told advisors that it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney
General Jefferson (Jeff) Sessions unrecuse from the Russia investigation and
to have the Special Counsel removed, and engaged in efforts to curtail the
Special Counsel's investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidence to it,
including through public and private contacts with potential witnesses. Those
and related actions are described and analyzed in Volume II of the report.

THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S CHARGING DECISIONS

In reaching the charging decisions described in Volume 1 of the report,
the Office determined whether the conduct it found amounted to a violation
of federal criminal law chargeable under the Principles of Federal
Prosecution. See Justice Manual § 9-27.000 et seq.  (2018). The standard
set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct constitutes a crime;
if so, whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain
and sustain a conviction; and whether prosecution would serve a substantial
federal interest that could not be adequately served by prosecution elsewhere
or through non-criminal alternatives. See Justice Manual §9-27.220.

Section V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office's
charging decisions, which contain three main components.

First, the Office determined that Russia's two principal interference
operations in the 2016 U.S. presidential election - the social media campaign
and the hacking-and-dumping operations - violated U.S. criminal law. Many of
the individuals and entities involved in the social media campaign have been
charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by
undermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with
regulating foreign influence in U.S. elections, as well as related counts
of identity theft. See United States v. Internet Research Agency, et al.,
No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.). Separately, Russian intelligence officers who carried
out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal email accounts
of individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate,
among other federal laws, the federal computer-intrusion statute, and the
have been so char ed. See United States v.  Netyksho, et al., No. 18-cr-215
(D.D.C.). [...]

Second, while the investigation identified numerous links between
individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated
with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal
charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any
Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or
other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting
and WikiLeaks's releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a
criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient
to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives
of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.

Third, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated
with the Trump Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about
their interactions with Russian-affiliated individuals and related
matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian
election interference. The Office charged some of those lies as violations
of the federal false-statements statute. Former National Security Advisor
Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with Russian
Ambassador Kislyak during the transition period. George Papadopoulos,
a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period, pleaded guilty to
lying to investigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his
interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the professor who told Papadopoulos that
the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton .in the form of thousands of
emails. Former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty
to making false statements to Congress about the Trump Moscow project.
And in February 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
found that Manafort lied to the Office and the grand jury concerning his
interactions and communications with Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign
polling data and a peace plan for Ukraine.

* * *

The Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported
to involve potential Russia-related contacts. For example, the investigation
established that interactions between Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump
Campaign officials both at the candidate's April 2016 foreign policy speech in
Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Republican National Convention
were brief, public, and non-substantive. And the investigation did not
establish that one Campaign official's efforts to dilute a portion of the
Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken
at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also did not
establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at
Sessions's Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the
presidential campaign.

The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony,
or a complete picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the
investigation. Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right
against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office's judgment,
appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit
of other witnesses and information-such as information known to attorneys or
individuals claiming to be members of the media-in light of internal Department
of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice Manual §§ 9-13.400, 13.410. Some
of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively
covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter 
(or "taint") team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed,
they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to
some of the false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced
practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as well-numerous
witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the
United States.

Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed
or whose conduct we investigated-including some associated with the Trump
Campaign - deleted relevant communications or communicated during the relevant
period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide for
long-term retention of data or communications records. In such cases, the
Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to
contemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements
that appeared inconsistent with other known facts.

Accordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations
that the Office believes to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent
possible, given these identified gaps, the Office cannot rule out the
possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional light on
(or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.
